Daring duck of mystery
Champion of right
Swoops out of the shadows
Darkwing owns the night
Somewhere, some villain schemes
But his number's up
(3-2-1)
Darkwing Duck
(When there's trouble, you call DW)
Darkwing Duck
(Let's get dangerous)
Darkwing Duck
(Darkwing, Darkwing Duck)
Cloud of smoke, and he appears
The Master of surprise
Who's that cunning mind behind
That shadowy disguise?
Nobody knows for sure
But bad guys are out of luck
'Cause here comes
Look out
(When there's trouble you call DW)
Darkwing Duck
(Let's get dangerous)
Darkwing Duck
(Better watch out, you bad boys)
